This implementation allows you to:

1. Create document groups that map to your database records using the `db_id` field
2. Add multiple authorized users to each document group
3. Generate document IDs that combine the on-chain object ID with your database document IDs
4. Properly use the Seal protocol for encryption and decryption
5. Have multiple wallets access the same documents when they're in the authorized list

To use this implementation:

1. Deploy the updated Move contract
2. Use the utility functions to create document groups, add users, and encrypt/decrypt documents
3. When encrypting documents, use your database CUIDs as part of the document ID
4. Store a mapping between your database CUID and the on-chain object ID

The contract will ensure that only authorized users can decrypt the documents, while the utility functions make it easy to integrate with your application.
